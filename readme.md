# Pub-Dev

This project is a mono-repo (of sorts) for the packages I've created along the way. Most of them were born for my own needs, some may be just amusing ideas I had once.

If you find them useful, enjoy!

## Packages

- [Geography](./geography)
  - ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Because I'm too cheap to pay for a geo-coding service, and I only needed City-level resolution.
