# Pub-Dev

![CI](https://github.com/GioCirque/pub-dev/actions/workflows/makefile_build.yml/badge.svg) ![CD](https://github.com/GioCirque/pub-dev/actions/workflows/makefile_deploy.yml/badge.svg)

This project is a mono-repo (of sorts) for the packages I've created along the way. Most of them were born for my own needs, some may be just amusing ideas I had once.

If you find them useful, enjoy!

## Packages

- [Geography](./geography)

  - ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Because I'm too cheap to pay for a geo-coding service, and I only needed City-level resolution.

- [Cobertura](./cobertura)

  - Easy way to quickly view `LCOV` results in the console (with or without colorization), and convert `LCOV` to `Cobertura` for GitHub and Azure.

- [dfat](./dfat)
  - The `dfat` CLI, facilitating the `dfat` solution template system for rapidly adding cloud backends to flutter apps.
