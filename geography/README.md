# geography

This is a constant data-as-code library called `geography` facilitating operations like:

- Search places by name
- Find the named place nearest to coordinates
- Measure distance between places

## Data Scope

This scope of this data is best represented as:

```
Earth > [Country] > [Region] > [City]
```

If you're looking to use basic locations from the coordinates provided by a device, this library will get you pretty far. If you're looking for more granularity, like addresses or business names, this library won't be a great fit for your project.
